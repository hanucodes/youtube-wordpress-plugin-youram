In this tribute to forgotten icons, queer culture historian and TED Fellow Channing Gerard Joseph shares their little-known stories, connecting the origins of drag in the 1880s to the present day and exploring the awesome power to choose how we define ourselves.\n\nIf you love watching TED Talks like this one, become a TED Member to support our mission of spreading ideas: https://ted.com/membership\n\nFollow TED! \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/TEDTalks\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ted\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/TED\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/ted-conferences\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@tedtoks\n\nThe TED Talks channel features talks, performances and original series from the world's leading thinkers and doers.

Tracing the industry's five-decade trickle of lies about climate science, she busts the myth that economic growth and stability are dependent on fossil fuels -- and issues a resounding message about how we can actually move towards a just climate world. \"[The future] won't be built for those who have brought us into this mess,\" she says. \"It will be built for everyone else.\"\n\nCountdown is TED's global initiative to accelerate solutions to the climate crisis. The goal: to build a better future by cutting greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030, in the race to a zero-carbon world.

Peni calls for us all to rethink who we consider experts, particularly when it comes to building in the face of climate change, showing how Indigenous wisdom must work in harmony with new science and technology if we want to create a sustainable future.\n\nIf you love watching TED Talks like this one, become a TED Member to support our mission of spreading ideas: http://ted.com/membership\n\nFollow TED! \nTwitter: http://twitter.com/TEDTalks\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ted\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/TED\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/ted-conferences\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@tedtoks\n\nThe TED Talks channel features talks, performances and original series from the world's leading thinkers and doers.
